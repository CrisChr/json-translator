# Developer-Centric: A Truly Code-Friendly Experience

We understand that for developers, the integrity of the code is paramount. Our tool is designed from the ground up to respect your code and streamline your workflow.

**1. Pristine Code Structure, Guaranteed:**
Our AI translation engine is meticulously trained to preserve every aspect of your JSON file's structure. Indentation, comments, and syntax are all kept intact, meaning you'll never have to waste time reformatting a translated file again.

**2. Clean Git Diffs for Easy Review:**
Because we don't alter the structure of your files, your version control history remains clean and easy to read. Git diffs will only show changes to the text values, making the code review process for localization updates straightforward and efficient for your entire team.

**3. Seamless Integration with Your Workflow:**
Copy the translated content directly from our user-friendly interface or download the fully formatted JSON files with a single click. There's no need for manual intervention, allowing you to integrate the translated files back into your project instantly.

**4. Smart Handling of Variables and HTML:**
Our tool is intelligent enough to recognize and preserve variable placeholders (like \`{{variable}}\`) and HTML tags within your JSON values. This ensures that your application's dynamic content and styling are not broken during the translation process.
