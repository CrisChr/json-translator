# Your Data Stays Yours: Uncompromising Data Security

In an era where data privacy is more important than ever, we've built our tool with a security-first approach. We believe that your data, your code, and your API keys are yours alone.

**1. All Processing Happens Locally in Your Browser:**
From the moment you upload a JSON file to the moment you download the translation, every operation happens entirely within your browser. Your files are never uploaded to our or any third-party servers, eliminating the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.

**2. Your API Keys Are Secure:**
Your API keys are treated like passwords. They are stored temporarily in your browser's session and are sent directly from your browser to the respective AI provider's API endpoint (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini). We never see, store, or proxy your keys.

**3. No Data Retention:**
Once you close the browser tab, all data associated with your session, including the content of your JSON files and your API keys, is permanently wiped. We do not log, track, or store any of your activity.

**4. Peace of Mind for Your Business:**
This client-side approach means you can translate sensitive or proprietary data with complete peace of mind, knowing that your business secrets and intellectual property are never exposed.
